Notes:
1) Not available in 2000-2001 datafile
2) Not available in all datafiles due to changing race/ethnicity category definitions over time. See data_cohort_map
3) Average faculty salary per month, calculated from the IPEDS Human Resources component. This metric is calculated as the total salary outlays divided by the number of months worked for all full-time nonmedical instructional staff. Prior to the 2011-12
   academic year, when months worked were reported in groups, the value for 9-10 months is estimated as 9.5 months and the value for 11-12 months is estimated as 11.5 months. Values prior to the 2003-04 academic year are limited to degree-granting 
   institutions for consistency with values in subsequent academic years.
4) Proportion of faculty that are employed full time, calculated from the IPEDS Human Resources component. This metric is calculated as the number of full-time nonmedical faculty divided by the total number of nonmedical faculty. Proportions are expressed 
   as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent.
5) The proportion of undergraduates who received a Pell grant in the academic year, calculated from the IPEDS Student Financial Aid component. This metric is calculated by IPEDS as the quotient of the number of Pell grant recipients divided by the count of
   all undergraduates for either a fall enrollment cohort (for institutions that primarily follow an academic year calendar system) or a full-year enrollment cohort (for institutions that primarily follow a continuous enrollment or program-based calendar 
   system). Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent. This metric is not available prior to the 2008-09 academic year.
6) The proportion of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate at the institution within 150 percent of normal time, calculated from the IPEDS Graduation Rates component. Separate metrics are
   calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. This metric is calculated as the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate divided by the number of full-time,
   first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates in the corresponding completion rate cohort (D150_4, D150_L4). For full-time, first-time, bachelor's degree-seeking undergraduates, 150 percent of normal time is typically 6 years, and for full-time,
   first-time, associate's degree-seeking undergraduates it is typically 3 years. For full-time, first-time, certificate-seeking undergraduates, the normal time period varies by the length of the program (for example, 9 months for a certificate with a
   normal completion time of 6 months). Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent. Pooled figures include two cohorts of students.
7) The proportion of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who were enrolled at the institution in the fall 1 year after starting at the institution, calculated from the IPEDS Fall Enrollment component. Separate metrics are
   calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. The retention rate is calculated as the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled in the fall of the prior academic year that are enrolled
   in the fall term of the current academic year divided by the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled in the fall of the prior academic year. For 4-year institutions, this metric is limited to full-time,
   first-time, bachelor's or equivalent degree-seeking undergraduate students. For less-than-4-year institutions, this metric applies to all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students. This metric is not available prior to
   the 2004-05 academic year. Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent.
