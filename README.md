# CaseStudySchoolProject

This is a good place for notes:

1. Data Cleaning

2. EDA

3. Model creation and selection (linear model / regression)

4. Model validation (cross validation)

5. Create presentation with key points and ideas

Brainstorm:

analyze the past 10-20 years across schools just to explore recent relationships and hopefully are representative of overall data
How we fill our missing values or whether we can or what we can remove
Do we split on open vs close admissions?
Do we split on race, gender?
